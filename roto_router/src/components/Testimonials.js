            <h3>Mary from Woodinville</h3>
            <p style={{fontStyle: "italic"}}>We had a gas leak that caused our gas to be turned off on a Friday night.  We called a different company 
                and were given an appointment for the next day.  When that appointment fell through the next day, my husband 
                and I were scrambling by afternoon to find another company who would or could come out and fix our gas 
                leak on a Saturday afternoon/evening.   Jeff called us back and told us he was on a job but he'd give us an 
                update in a couple of hours.  </p>

            <p style={{fontStyle: "italic"}}>When he called at 3:30, I was a little worried about how he was going to get the job done the same day.  He
                 stayed until nearly 11 pm! His work was professional and very knowledgeable.  According the PSE tech, he did
                  an amazing job and gave us a very fair price for the work he did.  I would certain call Resolute Plumbing 
                  and Heating again and recommend the company.</p>
