            When it's time to hire a plumber in Seattle, will you know which plumbing company to call? The number of genuine industry plumbers is dwindling, and the resulting trend is that local companies often bring in handymen apprentices to handle plumbing work that should be left to certified plumbers. Don't take chances with anyone lacking the credentials to handle your service call. At Bees Plumbing and Heating, what we do best is plumbing and sewer systems from repair to replacement. We can diagnose your problem and come up with a solution. We also excel at upgrading your home plumbing system to be safer, more reliable, and conserve energy and water. For commendable service from a licensed Seattle-area plumbing company, give our pros a call.
