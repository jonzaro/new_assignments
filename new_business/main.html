        <span class="titles">Did you know you share your home with critters?</span>
        <p>It is common for a variety of insects, rodents, and even reptiles to live near your home. (and sometimes IN your home) While some critters are harmful, most are actually safe to be around. Whether it be the spider in the attic or the scorpion in your yard, it is important to learn about your local critters. We have free resources to help you identify which critters in your area are "friend" or "foe". </p>
