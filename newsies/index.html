        <h1 class="classified-article">2020: The Most Unbelievable Year</h1>
        <p>On new years eve 2019, millions of people across the United States were filled with excitement and hope for
            the new year to come.
            People celebrated with their eyes on the future, aspiring for 2020 to be better than the 2019 they had just
            experienced.
            Unfortunately, it wouldn't be long into the new year before Americans looked back at 2019, longing to
            return. Within the first
            three months of 2020 <b>Australian brush fires raged out of control across the continent; legendary NBA
                player Kobe Bryant died in
                a tragic helicopter accident; the stock market took two separate 10% dives in on week; and the COVID-19
                virus has ravaged the
                globe.</b> <u>If I could give one piece of advice to the 2019 new years eve party-goer, it would be to
                turn around and run back to the
                loving embrace of 2019.</u>
