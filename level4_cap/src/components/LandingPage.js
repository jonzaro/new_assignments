                        The Food and Drug Administration is the oldest comprehensive consumer protection agency
                        in the U. S. federal government. Since 1848 the federal government has used chemical 
                        analysis to monitor the safety of agricultural products -- a responsibility inherited by
                        the Department of Agriculture in 1862 and later by the FDA.

                    What is a Recall? Food recalls are removals of foods from the market that are in violation of
                     the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulations. FDA regulates all foods except meat,
                      poultry, and processed egg products, which are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

                        We have designed and developed a custom search tool for consumers. The goal of this search tool was for 
                        consumers to havev an easier way to sort through the bulk of information provided by the FDA. If you found
                        this tool helpful, consider donating to recallinfo.com to help important work like this continue.
